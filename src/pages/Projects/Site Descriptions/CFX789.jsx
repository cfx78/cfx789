            Yes, I built this site too!

            <br />
            While I did use other sites for inspiration, I built this site from
            the ground up. I wanted to create a site that was simple, yet
            elegant. I also wanted to create a site that was easy to navigate
            and easy to read.
            <br />
            <br />
            This site was built with <span>React</span>. Styling was done with{' '}
            <span>Sass</span> and <span>Tailwind CSS</span>. I also used{' '}
            <span>AOS</span> for the animations. I used <span>Netlify</span> for
            deployment and <span>Vite</span> for bundling.
