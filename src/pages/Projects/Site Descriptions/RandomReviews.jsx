            Keeping with the theme of projects based on my interests, Random
            Reviews Blog is a blog site centered around the things I use for
            entertainment.
            <br />
            <br />
            All the reviews are written by me and are my own opinions. They are
            short and to the point. The four categories are: Movies, TV Shows,
            Video Games, and Music.
            <br />
            <br />I built this site with the intention of learning how to use a
            headless CMS. I used <span>Sanity</span>.<span>io</span> for the CMS
            and <span>Next.js 13</span> for the frontend. I went the extra mile
            and incorporated <span>SSG</span> to give the site even more speed.
            I also used <span>Tailwind CSS</span> for styling and{' '}
            <span>Vercel</span> for deployment.
